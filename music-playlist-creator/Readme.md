### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics that we discussed definitely helped me prepare to complete the assignment as we were able to cover everything that the project required of us at a minimal level and implement what we learned in our projects at an advanced level. I felt unprepared to complete every feature that involved Javascript so basically the Like bount, updated like count, the search button feature, the sort button feature, the shuffle button and the Featured section which are all implemnted in my script and scripts.js files.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would find a way to implement a like feature in the songs in the playlists as well as creating a delete feature that allows users to delete songs in the playlists. I would also try and cover the other stretch features like creating a button that allows users to create new and edit old playlists. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was able to improve on my public speaking skills infront of large groups by helping my audience visualize my implementation of specific features like the like button for example where I was able to show its interactive features and how it affects the playlist like count. I feel like i really did well and from the feedback I recieved, everyone involved said that I did a good job. I noticed a search button feature from one of my peers that i immediately tried to implement and it was a success.
